To fix this, you must first make sure you have an expo project created, you can do this by running `expo init my-expo-project` in your terminal.

After that, navigate into the project directory using `cd my-expo-project`. Then you can execute expo commands such as `expo start`.

If the issue still persists even after you're in the project directory, ensure the `package.json` and `expo.json` files are intact and contain the correct project details.  If necessary, you might consider deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
