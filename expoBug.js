This error typically occurs when you try to run an Expo CLI command that requires a project to be set up, but you're not currently inside an Expo project directory.  The CLI can't find the necessary `package.json` or `expo.json` file to understand what project it's working with. 

**Example Scenario:** You've opened your terminal, and directly tried to run `expo start` without navigating to an Expo project directory first.

**Another Example:** You might encounter this if your project's `package.json` is corrupted or missing vital Expo-related dependencies.
